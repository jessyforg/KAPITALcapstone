AI: "Market validation for a food delivery app in Baguio City 
requires a multi-step approach:

## Primary Market Research
1. **Survey Target Customers**
   - 200+ potential users across different barangays
   - Focus on ordering frequency, preferred cuisines, price sensitivity
   - Use Google Forms + social media for distribution

2. **Interview Restaurant Partners**
   - 20-30 local restaurants
   - Understand current delivery methods
   - Assess willingness to pay commission (15-25%)

## MVP Testing

[Detailed breakdown continues...]"
```

### Token Usage and Limits

#### Understanding Tokens
- **What are Tokens**: Units measuring AI processing
- **Calculation**: Roughly 4 characters = 1 token
- **Daily Limits**: 
  - Standard users: 5,000 tokens/day
  - Verified users: 10,000 tokens/day
  - Premium users: 25,000 tokens/day

#### Optimizing Token Usage

**Token-Efficient Strategies**:
- Ask focused questions rather than broad ones
- Build on previous responses rather than repeating context
- Use bullet points for multiple related questions
- Be concise while maintaining necessary detail

**Example - Efficient vs Inefficient**:

**‚ùå Inefficient (High Token Usage)**:
```
"I have a startup idea for a mobile app that connects 
local farmers with consumers who want to buy fresh produce 
directly from the farm. I'm thinking about how to make 
this work and what I need to do first. Can you help me 
understand everything I need to know about starting this 
business and what steps I should take?"
```

**‚úÖ Efficient (Lower Token Usage)**:
```
"For a farm-to-consumer marketplace app in the Philippines:
1. What's the best way to validate demand?
2. How should I approach farmer onboarding?
3. What are key metrics for a food marketplace?
```
