## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### PHP Code Standards
We follow PSR-12 coding standards:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Kapital\Services;

/**
 * User service for managing user operations
 */
class UserService
{
    private DatabaseConnection $conn;
    
    public function __construct(DatabaseConnection $connection)
    {
        $this->conn = $connection;
    }
    
    /**
     * Retrieve user by ID
     *
     * @param int $userId User identifier
     * @return array|null User data or null if not found
     */
    public function getUserById(int $userId): ?array
    {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

#### HTML/CSS Standards
```html
<!-- Use semantic HTML5 elements -->
<article class="startup-profile">
    <header class="startup-profile__header">
        <h1 class="startup-profile__title">Startup Name</h1>
    </header>
    <section class="startup-profile__content">
        <!-- Content here -->
    </section>
</article>
```

```css
/* Use BEM methodology for CSS classes */
.startup-profile {
    margin: 1rem 0;
}

.startup-profile__header {
    padding: 1rem;
    background-color: var(--primary-color);
}

.startup-profile__title {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    color: var(--text-primary);
}
```

#### JavaScript Standards
```javascript
// Use modern ES6+ features
const ApiService = {
    async fetchUserData(userId) {
        try {
            const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
            return await response.json();
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Failed to fetch user data:', error);
            throw error;
        }
    }
};

// Use descriptive variable names
const isUserVerified = user.verification_status === 'verified';
const hasStartupProfile = user.startup_profile_id !== null;
```

### Database Guidelines

#### Naming Conventions
```sql
-- Table names: plural, snake_case
CREATE TABLE startup_profiles (
    startup_profile_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Column names: snake_case
-- Use descriptive names
funding_stage VARCHAR(50)
verification_status ENUM('pending', 'verified', 'rejected')
```

#### SQL Best Practices
```php
// Always use prepared statements
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ? AND verification_status = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("ss", $email, $status);
$stmt->execute();

// Handle errors gracefully
if (!$stmt) {
    error_log("Database prepare failed: " . $conn->error);
    throw new DatabaseException("Query preparation failed");
}
```
